# Final Project Part I: U.S. Child Allowance

## Summary

A monthly Child Allowance would dramatically cut child poverty in the U.S. and would boost the declining feritility rate.

### The Story

1. In the introduction, I want to grab the audience's attention with an optimistic vision of the future -- to show them what is at stake. I will likely include public domain images of happy children to drive home the emotional impact.

2. This is where I introduce the first problem: the low fertility rate (Graph 1 below) and the gap between the amount of children that women would like to have and they actually have (Graph 2). This is a threat to the optimistic vision presented in the introduction.

3. Here, I introduce the second problem: the striking level of child poverty in the U.S. (Graph 3). Now the situation is even more bleak.

4. Next I show the audience a glimmer of hope. Congress has acted on this issue quite recently, and the solution was effective -- cutting child poverty in half (Graph 4*). I will also include a graph of Australia's success at boosting its fertility rate with a similar program. The U.S. policy was not in place long enough to make an impact on fertility rate.

5. However, the battle is not yet won. I will likely include an image of the Capitol here, as I believe the building can evoke a range of emotions. Frustraton with the deliberative process, but also optimism as it is the place where monumental change occurs.

6. Call to action. Implementing a Child Allowance is extremely feasible. Almost all wealthy countries have one, plus our Congress has already done it once. There is bipartisan support with proposals from both sides. As future leaders, we need to continue discussing publicly the benefits of a Child Allowance in order to draw attention and build public support.

'*' I drew my sketch for Graph 4 before finding an adequate data source, so it shows a longer time horizon than I actually have data for

## Initial Sketches

## Data Sources

Fertility statistics come from the CDC National Vital Statistics System (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm). This is a Federal compilation of data gleaned from birth certificates. I will use the ferility rate for Graph 1 (Declining Fertility Rate) and Graph 2 (Gap between desired and actual # of children).

I will also use data from the General Social Survey (https://gss.norc.org/). The GSS is conducted by the National Opinion Research Center and has been regularly collected since 1972. It collects information and keeps a record of concerns, experiences, attitudes, and practices of U.S. residents. I will use data about how many children women report wanting to have for Graph 2.

Further, I will use OECD data on poverty rates (https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm) for Graph 3 (Child Poverty in Wealthy Countries).

I will use monthly poverty data (https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/forecasting-monthly-poverty-data) from the Columbia University Center on Poverty & Social Policy for Graph 4 (U.S. Child Poverty over time).

## Method and Medium

I plan to use Shorthand to create my project. This platform will allow me to incorporate data visualizations, public domain images, and written text in order to effectively convey my story.
