I chose this visualization because it comes from a paper that I find has been extremely influential on my own thoughts about policy. The paper, titled "Cost Disease Socialism" (from the Niskanen Center), discusses the spiraling costs of important social goods (specifically, health care, housing, education, child care). While I find the economic analysis compelling, some of the data visualizations leave much to be desired. I thought it would be a fun exercise to take this graph on childcare preferences and make it clearer.
