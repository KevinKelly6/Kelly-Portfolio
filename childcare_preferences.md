# Childcare Preferences

### 1. The Original

I chose this visualization because it comes from a paper that I find has been extremely influential on my own thoughts about policy. The paper, titled "Cost Disease Socialism" (from the Niskanen Center), discusses the spiraling costs of important social goods (specifically, health care, housing, education, child care). While I find the economic analysis compelling, some of the data visualizations leave much to be desired. I thought it would be a fun exercise to take this graph on childcare preferences and make it clearer.

### 2. The Critique

The critique process made me realize that I had to focus on improving the visualization's "perceptibility" and "intuitiveness." The three features that stood out to me as needing immediate change were: (1) the color scheme; (2) the legend descriptions; and (3) the title. 

The multi-colored bars drew my attention to all of the bars, and therefore to none of them. I knew I had to develop a more logical color scheme. I also knew that the orignal legend descriptions were too long and contributed to clutter. I just didn't know how I wanted to change them yet. And finally, the original title was too vague. I wanted a title that told a story, and a subtitle that emphasized the policy implications discussed in the paper. My initial thoughts were â€œUpper class parents are outliers in preferring outside childcare" for the title and "Policies aimed at the affordability of childcare should directly subsidize parents, empowering them to spend their money as they please" for the subtitle.

### 3. The Wireframes

Before beginning my sketches, I decided to re-name and re-order the categories. I consolidated the first two categories (blue & green on the original) into one category called "At-Home Childcare." Next, I put "Family Childcare" (orange). Then, I put "Part-Time Outside Childcare" (yellow). Finally, I put "Full-Time Outside Childcare" (red). I feel this set of categories and ordering is more logical. Further, the shorter category names reduce clutter in the final visualization.

##### The Bar Graph

I was naturally inclined to begin with a bar chart. Here, I changed the color scheme to highlight the comparison between At-Home and Full-Time Outside Childcare, because this is the policy-relevant comparison. One of the primary discussions in childcare financing is whether the government should subsidize parents (e.g., with an expanded Child Tax Credit) or childcare facilities (e.g., subsidized/universal daycare). This graph is meant to visualize parents' preferences in order to inform this policy choice.

I also included the more specific title I came up with during the critique and a subtitle emphasizing policy implications. Finally, I removed clutter (horizontal gray lines and the survey language below the legend).

##### The Line Graph

My next sketch was a line graph. I thought maybe this would show the "trend" better. I honestly do not like line graphs when the horizontal axis is not "Time." I also do not like invoking the "up is good"/"down is bad" heuristic in this case. I do like the less cluttered X and Y axes.

##### The Grid of Pie Charts

My final sketch was a grid of pie charts. I thought this was a unique application of pie charts. I had never created a grid of pie charts before, so it was cool for me. This felt like the least cluttered of the designs. However, I was worried if audiences would be able to tell that yellow > blue once I created it digitally. This comparison is the crucial point of the visualization, because it shows that only Upper Class parents prefer Outside Childcare to At-Home Childcare.

### 4. The Feedback

I asked the five questions given on the assignment page as well as the question "Which graph should I use?" I found the feedback very valuable -- I learned a lot.

The most noticeable pattern was the preference for the pie chart. I myself was leaning more towards the bar chart (perhaps anchored by the original visualization), but in fact decided to change course after this feedback. Both interviewees expressed that the pie chart was by far the "least busy" of the visualizations and it made the story of the data most clear.

I was concerned that the idea of the Upper Class preferring Outside care would get lost in the pie chart, but one interviewee commented that the inverse idea (Lower Class prefers At-Home care) was made especially clear in the pie chart. I had not thought of this.

One interviewee thought that the graphs showed the amount of childcare "used" when it is actually the amount "preferred." This made me alter my title to be clearer on this matter.

One interviewee liked seeing the specific percentages on the bar chart, but still favored the pie chart. I knew I could incorporate the specific percentages on a digital pie chart with pop-ups.

One interviewee was unsurprised by the results because "outside care costs more." The point of this data is to show that lower income parents prefer At-Home care regardless of cost. There is always a tradeoff: forego income to stay at home, or pay for outside care. When presented with this trade-off, low-income parents still tend to prefer at-home care. This made me realize I had to alter my titles and subtitles to make this point clearer.
