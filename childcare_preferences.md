### The Original

I chose this visualization because it comes from a paper that I find has been extremely influential on my own thoughts about policy. The paper, titled "Cost Disease Socialism" (from the Niskanen Center), discusses the spiraling costs of important social goods (specifically, health care, housing, education, child care). While I find the economic analysis compelling, some of the data visualizations leave much to be desired. I thought it would be a fun exercise to take this graph on childcare preferences and make it clearer.

### The Critique

The critique process made me realize that I had to focus on improving the visualization's "perceptibility" and "intuitiveness." The three features that stood out to me as needing immediate change were: (1) the color scheme; (2) the legend descriptions; and (3) the title. 

The multi-colored bars drew my attention to all of the bars, and therefore to none of them. I knew I had to develop a more logical color scheme. I also knew that the orignal legend descriptions were too long and contributed to clutter. I just didn't know how I wanted to change them yet. And finally, the original title was too vague. I wanted a title that told a story, and a subtitle that emphasized the policy implications discussed in the paper. My initial thoughts were â€œUpper class parents are outliers in preferring outside childcare" for the title and "Policies aimed at the affordability of childcare should directly subsidize parents, empowering them to spend their money as they please" for the subtitle.
