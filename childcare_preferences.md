# Childcare Preferences

### The Original

I chose this visualization because it comes from a paper that I find has been extremely influential on my own thoughts about policy. The paper, titled "Cost Disease Socialism" (from the Niskanen Center), discusses the spiraling costs of important social goods (specifically, health care, housing, education, child care). While I find the economic analysis compelling, some of the data visualizations leave much to be desired. I thought it would be a fun exercise to take this graph on childcare preferences and make it clearer.

### The Critique

The critique process made me realize that I had to focus on improving the visualization's "perceptibility" and "intuitiveness." The three features that stood out to me as needing immediate change were: (1) the color scheme; (2) the legend descriptions; and (3) the title. 

The multi-colored bars drew my attention to all of the bars, and therefore to none of them. I knew I had to develop a more logical color scheme. I also knew that the orignal legend descriptions were too long and contributed to clutter. I just didn't know how I wanted to change them yet. And finally, the original title was too vague. I wanted a title that told a story, and a subtitle that emphasized the policy implications discussed in the paper. My initial thoughts were â€œUpper class parents are outliers in preferring outside childcare" for the title and "Policies aimed at the affordability of childcare should directly subsidize parents, empowering them to spend their money as they please" for the subtitle.

### The Wireframes

Before beginning my sketches, I decided to re-name and re-order the categories. I consolidated the first two categories (blue & green on the original) into one category called "At-Home Childcare." Next, I put "Family Childcare" (orange). Then, I put "Part-Time Outside Childcare" (yellow). Finally, I put "Full-Time Outside Childcare" (red). I feel this set of categories and ordering is more logical. Further, the shorter category names reduce clutter in the final visualization.

##### The Bar Graph

I was naturally inclined to begin with a bar chart. Here, I changed the color scheme to highlight the comparison between At-Home and Full-Time Outside Childcare, because this is the policy-relevant comparison. One of the primary discussions in childcare financing is whether the government should subsidize parents (e.g., with an expanded Child Tax Credit) or childcare facilities (e.g., subsidized/universal daycare). This graph is meant to visualize parents' preferences in order to inform this policy choice.

I also included the more specific title I came up with during the critique and a subtitle emphasizing policy implications. Finally, I removed clutter (horizontal gray lines and the survey language below the legend).

##### The Line Graph

My next sketch was a line graph. I thought maybe this would show the "trend" better. I honestly do not like line graphs when the horizontal axis is not "Time." I also do not like invoking the "up is good"/"down is bad" heuristic in this case. I do like the less cluttered X and Y axes.

##### The Grid of Pie Charts
