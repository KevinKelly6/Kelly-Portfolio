### Research Protocol

a. My target audience is the general public and policymakers, to inform all parties of the issue and its importance.

b. I identified individuals with varying political views and varying relations to policy. I interviewed one liberal with a policy degree, one conservative with a law degree, and one libertarian with a marketing degree.

c. 
##### Interview Script
These questions gave me some really useful feedback last time, so I figured I would use them again.

1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?

d. Findings

##### Interview 1
1. "I assume a child allowance and child tax credits are the same? This appears to be an effort to increase the child birth rate by providing a monetary incentive."
2. "That paying families $3,000 per year per child will lower the poverty rate and increase child birth rate."
3. "I'm confused by the use of the phrase 'child allowance.'"
4. "Probably law makers and to gain support from the public."
5. "I wouldn't use the phrase 'child allowance' because it sounds like the money is being given to the child."

My main takeaway from this interview is to be more consistent with my terms. I alternated between using "child allowance" and "child tax credit" and this is unecessarily confusing. It seems child tax credit is more readily understood, so I will go with that moving forward.

##### Interview 2
1. "This is a website page dedicated to showcasing the continuing problem of low child birth in the U.S. and a possible solution."
2. "This page is telling me that there is a troublingly low birthrate in the U.S. and that there is a large number of children born in poverty."
3. "I found the notion that the child tax credit cut child poverty in half as surprising."
4. "The intended audience is the general public, meant to inform them of the issue and a potential solution."
5. "I think the word blurbs could be a bit longer."

This interview made me feel confident that my major points hit: the startling fertility situation in the U.S., and the tremendous poverty-reducing effects of the CTC. I will certainly consider adding more words, but this will depend on how long my rehearsed presentations take. If I find myself consistently presenting under a minute, I can expand the written content.

##### Interview 3
1. "An info page intended to showcase the alarming decrease in U.S. fertility and an attempt to boost support for a child tax credit."
2. "It's showing how a child tax credit can attempt to help slow and potentially rectify the decreasing birthrate in the U.S."
3. "I found it really surprising that the U.S. had a 21% child poverty rate despite being one of the wealthiest nations."
4. "It's definitely intended for the general public but I believe it could also be targeting those within the age group most likely to be having children/wanting to have children."
5. "More written info on each slides wouldn't be bad."

Again, this gave me confidence that my key point hit. Something this interview touched on that I hadn't considered: perhaps the presentation persuades young parents in particular to be animated about such a proposal. Like I mentioned, I will address how much content I can add once I start rehearsing.
