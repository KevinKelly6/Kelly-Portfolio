Kevin Kelly (kjkelly.andrew.cmu.edu)

### About me
I studied Behavioral Ecomomics at CMU and am currently enrolled in the MS-DC program at Heinz. My goal after graduating is to work in Congress, most preferably on a committee staff (Joint Economic Committee is top choice). In my spare time I enjoy reading about economics and golfing with my friends and family. Excited for this class!

### What I hope to learn
I of course want to learn how to make highly effective data visualizations. I love stories and want to be able to tell them -- with data! I want to be able to take complex topics and distill them into a medium that I can share with others even if they are not familiar with the subject.
