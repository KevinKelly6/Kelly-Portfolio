Kevin Kelly (kjkelly.andrew.cmu.edu)

### About me
I studied Behavioral Ecomomics at CMU and am currently enrolled in the MS-DC program at Heinz. My goal after graduating is to work in Congress, most preferably on a committee staff (Joint Economic Committee is top choice). In my spare time I enjoy reading about economics and golfing with my friends and family. Excited for this class!

### What I hope to learn
I of course want to learn how to make highly effective data visualizations. I love stories and want to be able to tell them -- with data! I want to be able to take complex topics and distill them into a medium that I can share with others even if they are not familiar with the subject.

### Data Viz 2: OECD Debt-to-GDP Ratio

Per their website, OECD's measurement of government debt is a signal for the sustainability of government finance. Therefore, the countries with the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios have the most sustainable financial situation. Each of these visualizations tells a different story with respect to OECD countries' debt-to-GDP ratio.

The first visualization, the bar chart, shows the current state of OECD countries' finances. The second visualization, the line grid, shows trends over time and compares every single country on one plane. The final visualization, the line race, also shows trends over time; however, this chart directly compares the relationships between each country's debt-to-GDP ratio. I chose the line race because it clearly shows how much of an outlier Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio is, and it shows the rapid changes that countries' ratios can make over time.
