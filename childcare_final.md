My final data visualization makes it clear that low-income parents prefer At-Home Childcare, regardless of cost. Upper Class parents are unique in preferring Outside care to At-Home care. As the subtitle indicates, the policy prescription given this data is to implement direct cash transfers (e.g., an expanded Child Tax Credit) rather than subsidized or universal daycare. Putting the money in parents' hands rather than in the hands of daycare facilities will empower low-income parents to make the childcare arrangements they desire.

I ultimately selected this visualization due to the feedback I received. I want the story to be clear, and I am fairly agnostic about how I do that. My interviewees agreed that the pie chart is least cluttered and most effective, so I went with that. I also think that a pie chart works best with survey data, which is what I have. 

Unlike the original visualization, I really wanted to hammer home the comparison between At-Home Childcare and Outside Childcare. I did this via my color scheme. I grayed out the inbetween or combination arrangements and highlighted the relevant ones.
