# Final Project Part III: Save the Expanded Child Tax Credit

## Project Write-Up

For this project, I was motivated to by the notion that an Expanded Child Tax Credit would dramatically cut U.S. child poverty and boost the declining fertility rate. I wanted to commmunicate this story to my audience, and effective data visualizations would make the story that much more compelling. I began by outlining the story, which would serve as the framework for my final report.

My initial story was told in six parts:

1. In the introduction, I want to grab the audience's attention with an optimistic vision of the future -- to show them what is at stake. I will likely include public domain images of happy children to drive home the emotional impact.

2. This is where I introduce the first problem: the low fertility rate and the gap between the amount of children that women would like to have and they actually have. This is a threat to the optimistic vision presented in the introduction.

3. Here, I introduce the second problem: the striking level of child poverty in the U.S. Now the situation is even more bleak.

4. Next I show the audience a glimmer of hope. Congress has acted on this issue quite recently, and the solution was effective -- cutting child poverty in half. I will also include a graph of Australia's success at boosting its fertility rate with a similar program. The U.S. policy was not in place long enough to make an impact on fertility rate.

5. However, the battle is not yet won. I will likely include an image of the Capitol here, as I believe the building can evoke a range of emotions. Frustraton with the deliberative process, but also optimism as it is the place where monumental change occurs.

6. Call to action. Implementing a Child Allowance is extremely feasible. Almost all wealthy countries have one, plus our Congress has already done it once. There is bipartisan support with proposals from both sides. As future leaders, we need to continue discussing publicly the benefits of a Child Allowance in order to draw attention and build public support.

I translated this story into a [draft shorthand report](https://preview.shorthand.com/Iqs674OlvaGcbNj5?_gl=1*jnxyah*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NDQ3MTM5NTkuQ2owS0NRaUEwcDJRQmhEdkFSSXNBQUNTT09PeGZVMGtialNRWWxhc0hUZWNnU3d4YlhZSzZ4bE9lM2E1eEM1dDZ1c184ZVV6X1Y2QWJhQWFBcWxfRUFMd193Y0I).
