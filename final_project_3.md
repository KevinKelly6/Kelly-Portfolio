## Project Write-Up

#### Motivation
For this project, I was motivated to by the notion that an Expanded Child Tax Credit would dramatically cut U.S. child poverty and boost the declining fertility rate. I began by outlining the story, which would serve as the framework for my final report.

#### Story
My initial story was told in six parts:

1. In the introduction, I want to grab the audience's attention with an optimistic vision of the future -- to show them what is at stake. I will likely include public domain images of happy children to drive home the emotional impact.

2. This is where I introduce the first problem: the low fertility rate and the gap between the amount of children that women would like to have and they actually have. This is a threat to the optimistic vision presented in the introduction.

3. Here, I introduce the second problem: the striking level of child poverty in the U.S. Now the situation is even more bleak.

4. Next I show the audience a glimmer of hope. Congress has acted on this issue quite recently, and the solution was effective -- cutting child poverty in half. I will also include a graph of Australia's success at boosting its fertility rate with a similar program. The U.S. policy was not in place long enough to make an impact on fertility rate.

5. However, the battle is not yet won. I will likely include an image of the Capitol here, as I believe the building can evoke a range of emotions. Frustraton with the deliberative process, but also optimism as it is the place where monumental change occurs.

6. Call to action. Implementing a Child Allowance is extremely feasible. Almost all wealthy countries have one, plus our Congress has already done it once. There is bipartisan support with proposals from both sides. As future leaders, we need to continue discussing publicly the benefits of a Child Allowance in order to draw attention and build public support.

#### Draft
I translated this story into a [draft shorthand report](https://preview.shorthand.com/Iqs674OlvaGcbNj5?_gl=1*jnxyah*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NDQ3MTM5NTkuQ2owS0NRaUEwcDJRQmhEdkFSSXNBQUNTT09PeGZVMGtialNRWWxhc0hUZWNnU3d4YlhZSzZ4bE9lM2E1eEM1dDZ1c184ZVV6X1Y2QWJhQWFBcWxfRUFMd193Y0I). My target audience for this report is the general public. I wanted this report to persuade members of the general public to support the policy and use the power of public opinion to urge Congress to take action.

#### Changes from Draft to Final
Next, I solicited feedback on the draft report. I interviewed three people with varying political views and relationships to public policy: one liberal with a policy degree, one conservative with a law degree, and one libertarian with a marketing degree. I wanted to see how this story tested with different political ideologies, and how well it was understood even by people who did not formally study policy.

One pattern within the feedback was the desire for more text in the report. My initial thoughts were to keep it simple, but I overdid it in that respect. Another notable piece of feedback was confusion with the terms "Child Tax Credit" and "Child Allowance." I used these terms interchangeably, which caused unnecessary confusion.

The first changes I made from Part II to Part III, consistent with the feedback I received, were: (1) add more text to my report and (2) strictly use "Child Tax Credit" to refer to the proposed policy. I also altered the Call to Action. My initial call was not sufficiently actionable. Thus, in my final report I included a petition that the audience can sign to urge Congress to pass an Expanded Child Tax Credit. Finally, I reorganized the structure of the report. I decided to dive right into the data and cut most of the photography from my original introduction. The first photograph is sufficient and the new structure streamlines the delivery of the content.

#### Design Choices
I wanted to have a consistent color scheme across the entire report. I used a blue with the hex code #0089ae across Shorthand and Flourish. This blue reminds me of a business report or policy explainer, and I wanted to invoke the professionalism and competence of these types of documents. I used a blue background in the report to neutrally explain the issues, a black background when I wanted to invoke a sense of despair, and a white background when I wanted to invoke a sense of hope. I used imagery that incorporates the American flag, to invoke a sense of patriotism and associate the policy with notions of a better country. Throughout the report, I aimed to blend factual arguments with appeals to emotion.

#### Datasets

For my first graph ("U.S. fertility rate is below replacement level, and falling") I used fertility data from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=US). I plotted U.S. fertility (births per woman) from 1980 to 2019 and included a "Replacement Rate" line at [2.1 births per woman](https://www.wri.org/research/achieving-replacement-level-fertility#:~:text=%E2%80%9CReplacement%20level%20fertility%E2%80%9D%20is%20the,modestly%20vary%20with%20mortality%20rates.), which is consistent with researchers' generally-accepted value.

For my second graph ("U.S. women are not able to have as many children as they would like") I used the same fertility data from The World Bank to create the "How many children women are having" line. I used data from [MacroTrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/fertility-rate#:~:text=The%20current%20fertility%20rate%20for,a%200.11%25%20increase%20from%202020.) to fill in data for the year 2021. I used data from [The General Social Survey](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/vfilter) to create the "How many children women want to have" line.

For my third graph ("Child Poverty Rates of G7 Countries") I used [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm) data on the child poverty rates of G7 countries. I used data from the earliest year available.

For my fourth graph ("The Expanded CTC dramatically reduced child poverty") I used monthly U.S. poverty data from the [Center on Poverty & Social Policy at Columbia University](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/forecasting-monthly-poverty-data). I highlighted the moment when the Expanded Child Tax Credit was passed (as part of the American Rescue Plan) and when it expired. Given the limitations of my data and visualization software, I had to place the "CTC Expanded" line on Febryary 2021, even though the American Rescue Plan went into effect on March 11, 2021. However, the monthly poverty data is from the end of each month, so the effects of the Expanded CTC would not show up in the data until the "March 2021" point. If I had more granular data, I could have put the "CTC Expanded" line directly on March 11; or, if the software allowed me to put a line between February and March, I could have done that. But, given these limitations, this is the best approximation.

The book [*One Billion Americans*](https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger-ebook/dp/B082ZR6827/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3BWDEHIERUOT7&keywords=one+billion+americans&qid=1646191831&sprefix=one+bill%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-1) by Matthew Yglesias was foundational to my thinking on this subject, and is cited in the report. Further, I used information from the article [“Cash for Kids? Assessing the American Family Act”](https://ifstudies.org/blog/cash-for-kids-assessing-the-american-family-act) by Lyman Stone.
